# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a pixel art video game built with Python that teaches cloud computing concepts through interactive gameplay. Players advance through levels while learning about cloud technologies, services, and best practices, with combat mechanics that reinforce learning objectives. The game combines educational content with engaging gameplay to make cloud concepts accessible and memorable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate through pixel art environments using keyboard controls, so that I can explore the game world and progress through levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses arrow keys or WASD THEN the character SHALL move in the corresponding direction
2. WHEN the player reaches the edge of a level THEN the system SHALL prevent movement beyond boundaries
3. WHEN the player collides with solid objects THEN the character SHALL stop moving in that direction
4. WHEN the player moves THEN the character sprite SHALL animate appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to learn cloud concepts through interactive lessons integrated into gameplay, so that I can gain knowledge while having fun.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player encounters a learning station THEN the system SHALL display cloud concept information
2. WHEN the player completes a lesson THEN the system SHALL unlock related gameplay mechanics
3. WHEN the player answers quiz questions correctly THEN the system SHALL award experience points
4. WHEN the player demonstrates understanding THEN the system SHALL allow progression to advanced topics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to fight enemies that represent cloud challenges or misconceptions, so that I can reinforce my learning through combat mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player encounters an enemy THEN the system SHALL initiate combat mode
2. WHEN the player uses cloud knowledge correctly in combat THEN the system SHALL deal damage to enemies
3. WHEN the player defeats an enemy THEN the system SHALL reward experience points and unlock content
4. WHEN the player's health reaches zero THEN the system SHALL restart the current level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to progress through multiple levels with increasing difficulty, so that I can gradually master more complex cloud concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player completes level objectives THEN the system SHALL unlock the next level
2. WHEN the player advances levels THEN the system SHALL introduce new cloud concepts
3. WHEN the player reaches higher levels THEN enemies SHALL become more challenging
4. WHEN the player completes all levels THEN the system SHALL display completion achievements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my progress and achievements tracked, so that I can monitor my learning journey and feel motivated to continue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player gains experience THEN the system SHALL update the progress display
2. WHEN the player learns new concepts THEN the system SHALL add them to a knowledge inventory
3. WHEN the player achieves milestones THEN the system SHALL unlock badges or achievements
4. WHEN the player opens the progress menu THEN the system SHALL show completed topics and remaining objectives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want pixel art graphics and sound effects that create an engaging retro gaming experience, so that the learning process feels enjoyable and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display pixel art sprites and backgrounds
2. WHEN game events occur THEN the system SHALL play appropriate sound effects
3. WHEN the player performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through animations
4. WHEN different areas are accessed THEN the system SHALL display themed pixel art representing different cloud services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly on my computer with Python, so that I can focus on learning without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize within 5 seconds
2. WHEN gameplay is active THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 30 FPS
3. WHEN the player saves progress THEN the system SHALL store game state reliably
4. WHEN the player loads a saved game THEN the system SHALL restore the exact previous state
